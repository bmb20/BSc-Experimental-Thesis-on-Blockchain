# BSc-Experimental-Thesis-on-Blockchain
This thesis explores Blockchain Online Social Media (BOSMs), decentralized platforms leveraging blockchain technology to enhance user privacy and transparency. Specifically, it focuses on the Yup platform, which uses blockchain technology, including Ethereum and EOS, to implement an innovative token economy with the YUP token.

The study is divided into two phases: data collection and analysis. The first phase involves gathering transaction data related to YUP tokens through Ethereum's blockchain explorer, Etherscan. The second phase focuses on analyzing user activities, including trading and staking behaviors, to understand the economic implications of the platform. Results show that users often transfer their YUP tokens to Ethereum for financial operations such as trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap V2, illustrating the integration of digital economy principles within social platforms.

This research highlights the evolving role of decentralized social media in addressing challenges such as privacy, equitable resource distribution, and freedom of thought. BOSMs like Yup not only empower users to monetize their social interactions but also provide opportunities to engage with broader financial ecosystems, including trading and investment activities.

Conclusions and Future Work
Social media have become essential in modern communication but are often associated with privacy and freedom concerns. Decentralized platforms based on blockchain, such as Yup, represent a new generation of social media that offers solutions for better privacy management and economic fairness. However, the increasing economic focus within these platforms raises questions about their social objectives.

Key findings include:
- Users predominantly utilize YUP tokens for economic activities rather than social interactions.
- The presence of MEV (Miner Extractable Value) attacks, such as sandwich attacks, reveals vulnerabilities in Ethereumâ€™s DeFi architecture.

Future research could delve deeper into:
- User identity analysis: Understanding pseudonymized data and its potential linkage to personal identities via social media accounts.
- Ether transfer dynamics: Examining the flow and purpose of Ether transactions between Yup users.
- Flashbot interactions: Investigating the impact of MEV mitigation strategies and their effectiveness in safeguarding transactions.
  
This work contributes to understanding the interplay between digital economies and decentralized social networks, offering insights for future developments in blockchain-based platforms.
